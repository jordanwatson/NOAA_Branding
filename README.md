# NOAA_Branding

NOAA has an official set of colors that are meant to contribute to the overall "brand." I have simply compiled the set of official NOAA colors so that they are in one place and easier to access if people are interested in incorporating these colors into their R work. 

The names that I have created are arbitrary - simply descriptions that I thought made sense based on the guidance put together in the accompanying NOAA brand pdf.
